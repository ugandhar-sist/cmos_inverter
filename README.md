# CMOS Inverter Design using Cadence Software

## Overview

This repository contains the design and simulation of a CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) inverter using Cadence software. The design incorporates both PMOS (P-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) and NMOS (N-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) transistors to achieve the inverting functionality.

## Design Process

### 1. Layout Design

- Created a layout for the CMOS inverter using Cadence software.
- The layout includes the PMOS and NMOS transistors, as well as the necessary connections for the inverter.

### 2. Symbol Creation

- Converted the layout into a symbol for schematic entry.
- Ensured that the symbol accurately represents the CMOS inverter design.

### 3. Schematic Design

- Designed a schematic for the CMOS inverter by placing and connecting the created symbol.
- Specified the power supply connections and input/output nodes.

### 4. Simulation and Validation

- Executed simulations to validate the design.
- Compared the simulation results from both layout and schematic to ensure the design meets the expected specifications.

## Simulation Results

The simulation results confirmed that the CMOS inverter operates correctly, providing the desired inverting functionality. The comparison between the layout and schematic allowed for observation of differences between practical and theoretical values, highlighting any discrepancies and areas for improvement.
